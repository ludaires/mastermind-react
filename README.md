# Mastermind Game (React)

This is an implementation of a mastermind game, which can be played by a user "against" the computer. 
This is a game where a player tries to guess the number combinations. At the end of each attempt to guess the 
4 number combinations, the computer will provide feedback whether the player had guess a number correctly, or/and 
a number and digit correctly. A player must guess the right number combinations within 10 attempts to win the game.
